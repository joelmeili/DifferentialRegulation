Single-cell RNA sequencing data has become more and more popular over the past few years. It allows answering biological questions that with bulk RNA sequencing could not be answered as cell-specific characteristics can be analyzed. In this thesis we investigate, in each cell cluster (e.g. cell type), how the relative abundance of spliced and unspliced reads varies between experimental conditions. Changes to these relative abundances are directly linked to gene regulation, therefore differences in these proportions are taken as a proxy for differences in gene regulation. Methods that are capable of detecting differences in relative abundance already exist (e.g. \emph{BRIE2} and \emph{eisaR}), however they neglect two sources of mapping uncertainty: i) multi-mapping reads across spliced and unspliced versions of a gene, and ii) reads compatible with multiple genes. Therefore, we propose a novel method, \emph{DifferentialRegulation},  that tackles this issue and evaluate the performance of the existing methods (\emph{BRIE2}, \emph{DEXSeq} and \emph{eisaR}) and our novel approach. For this we created two semi-simulated data sets, using real mouse kidney single-cell RNA sequencing data as an anchor data set to simulate from. From the analysis we conclude that the two methods that account for mapping uncertainty (\emph{DEXSeq} and \emph{DifferentialRegulation}) have significantly higher TPR and better control of FDR than the methods that ignore mapping uncertainty. Additionally, we studied methods robustness by investigating how gene abundance levels, and differential gene expression (a nuisance effect in this analysis), affect the results of each method. We also ran a null analysis on a real data set (where no differences between groups are expected), to study methods' false positive rates. Lastly, we ran a computational benchmark on the mouse kidney data to evaluate the computational burden of each method.
